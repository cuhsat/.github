# ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
My projects are either chaotically developed or sporadically maintained. Feel free to look around. All of my DFIR projects can be found under [Hinterland Forensics](https://github.com/stars/cuhsat/lists/hinterland-forensics). These projects are mostly well tested and documented.
-Cheers!
