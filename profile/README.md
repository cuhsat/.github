# 👋 Hello there!
I'm Christian, and I enjoy writing software in the cyber security field. My projects are either chaotically developed or sporadically maintained. All of my DFIR projects can be found under [Hinterland Forensics](https://github.com/stars/cuhsat/lists/hinterland-forensics). These projects are mostly well tested and documented.
