# 👋 Gude!
I'm Christian, and I enjoy writing software in the **Cyber Security** field. My projects are either chaotically developed or sporadically maintained. All of my **DFIR** projects can be found under [Hinterland Forensics](https://github.com/stars/cuhsat/lists/hinterland-forensics). These projects are usually well tested and documented.
