Hello there! I'm Christian, and I enjoy writing software in the **Cyber Security** field. My other projects are either chaotically developed or sporadically maintained. All of my **DFIR** projects can be found [here](https://github.com/stars/cuhsat/lists/forensics). I'm also the author of the [![Forensic Examiner](fox.png "Forensic Examiner")](https://forensic-examiner.eu)
